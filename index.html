<h3>Home Page</h3>
Heyo this is Cool Paarth aka Paarth aka SignificantWall. And this is my official site where I code, talk about things or just express my thoughts in general. Atleast that is what my 
IT teacher told as the main function of sites. You can access the pages bar and checkout Main pages from there but to access minor pages like posts or tutorials you will have to access from the contents page.
